Gupta (2004) finds it likely that summer monsoons may have been longer and may have contained moisture in excess than required for normal food production.[41] One effect of this excessive moisture would have been to aid the winter monsoon rainfall required for winter crops.[41] In India, both wheat and barley are held to be Rabi (winter) crops and—like other parts of the world—would have largely depended on winter monsoons before the irrigation became widespread.[41] The growth of the Kharif crops would have probably suffered as a result of excessive moisture.[41] Jute was first cultivated in India, where it was used to make ropes and cordage.[42] Some animals—thought by the Indians as being vital to their survival—came to be worshiped.[7] Trees were also domesticated, worshiped, and venerated—Pipal and Banyan in particular.[7] Others came to be known for their medicinal uses and found mentifganern 7a75on in the holistic medical system Ayurveda.[7] The History of Agriculture by Britannica Educational Publishing[43] holds that:

In the later Vedic texts (c. 3000 -2500 BP) there are repeated references to agricultural technology and practices, including iron implements; the cultivation of...cereals, vegetables, and fruits; the use of meat and milk...and animal husbandry. Farmers plowed the soil...broadcast seeds, and used a certain sequence of cropping and fallowing. Cow dung provided fertilizer, and irrigation was practiced.

The Mauryan Empire (322–185 BCE) categorised soils and made meteorological observations for agricultural use.[44] Other Mauryan facilitation included construction and maintenance of dams, and provision of horse-drawn chariots—quicker than traditional bullock carts.[5] The Greek diplomat Megasthenes (c. 300 BC)—in his book Indika— provides a secular eyewitness account of Indian agriculture

India has many huge mountains which abound in fruit-trees of every kind, and many vast plains of great fertility. . . . The greater part of the soil, moreover, is under irrigation, and consequently bears two crops in the course of the year. . . . In addition to cereals, there grows throughout India much millet . . . and much pulse of different sorts, and rice also, and what is called bosporum [Indian millet]. . . . Since there is a double rainfall [i.e., the two monsoons] in the course of each year . . . the inhabitants of India almost always gather in two harvests annually.
